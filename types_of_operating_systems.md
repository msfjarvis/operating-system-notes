# Types of Operating Systems

Operating Systems are classified under multiple categories depending on their scheduling and execution techniques. Some more common types of Operating Systems are as follows:

* Multiple programming OS
* Multiple processing OS
* Time sharing OS
* Real-time OS
* Network OS
* Parallel OS

## Multiple programming OS

An OS that can run multiple *programs* on a *single* processor is a multiple programming OS.

## Multiple processing OS

An OS that can execute multiple *programs* in parallel on *multiple* processors is a multiple processing OS.

## Time sharing OS

Operating Systems that schedule tasks based on a set quota of time and offload them when the time is up regardless of completion state are called time sharing OSes.

## Real-time OS

They are of two types, soft real-time OS and hard real-time OS.
